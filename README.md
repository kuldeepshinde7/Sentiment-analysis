1. Problem Statement: This project involves analysing customer reviews to determine their sentiment whether positive or negative. By using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project processes text data, trains a machine learning model to classify sentiments and generates actionable insights. The analysis helps businesses understand customer opinions and improve their products or services based on feedback.

2. Dataset Description:
•	Source: YELP Dataset
•	Files Used: reviews.csv, user.csv, business.csv, tip.csv,checkin.csv

3. Project Workflow:
•	Data Collection: Loading and merging relevant CSV files
•	Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, text preprocessing (removing punctuation, stopwords, and special characters)
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding text distributions and sentiment proportions
•	Feature Engineering: Extracting features using TF-IDF
•	Modelling: Training machine learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree.
•	Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using accuracy, Precision and confusion matrix
•	Summary Report

4. Tools and Libraries:
•	Python
•	pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, spacy.
•	PySpark (for big data processing)

5. Evaluation Metrics:
•	Accuracy
•	Precision
•	Recall
•	Confusion Matrix

6. Result:
•	Generate a Summary Report
